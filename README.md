## WARNING

DO NOT USE PORTAINER, it is known to not work and typically breaks things...
From the various discussions I've seen in the Arr communities and
Linuxserver.io, they tend to trend on saying to avoid it... If your using
portainer and this is not functioning as expected, that is likely your
problem.... (Example:
<https://github.com/RandomNinjaAtk/arr-scripts/discussions/57>)

Also see here: <https://wiki.servarr.com/docker-guide#portainer>

## Support Info

Scripts are provided as-is... Generally, if a script works one time, it will
work everytime, that is the nature of scripts... So if you're experiencing an
issue that has not been previously reported and is more likely a technical
problem of some sort, it is more than likely caused by user error...

Please note that use of arr-scripts is not supported by the Arr app's community.
The scripts do not modify the software/code of the Arr app, all changes to the
Arr app are implemented using using publicly available API calls.
